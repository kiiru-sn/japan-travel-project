            <h3>Tokyo, The City of Lights</h3>
            <p>
              Tokyo is the administrative, cultural, financial, commercial, and
              educational centre of Japan and the focus of an extensive urban
              complex that includes Kawasaki and Yokohama. Attractions include
              the Imperial Palace, encircled by stone-walled moats and broad
              gardens, and numerous temples and shrines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, otaku culture in Japan is more than just the stores outside
              of Akihabara Station! All around the city, you can find museums,
              bookstores, and even entire neighborhoods that celebrate Japanese
              manga and anime! Here‚Äôs our guide to the best places to shop,
              explore, and learn about your favorite movies and shows!

                  The lively hub of Shibuya is arguably the youth heart and soul
                  of the city, and unmissable if you're visiting the Tokyo area.
                  With world-famous sights including the iconic scramble
                  crossing, this area is a must-see for nightlife and trendy
                  youth culture

                <p>
                  One of the first places I went to on my first day in Japan.
                  It's something I've been wanting to experience for many, many
                  years. Also, had to do the Shibuya scramble as well!

                <p>
                  Asakusa's main attraction is Sensoji, a very popular Buddhist
                  temple, built in the 7th century. The temple is approached via
                  the Nakamise, a shopping street that has been providing temple
                  visitors with a variety of traditional, local snacks and
                  tourist souvenirs for centuries.

                <p>
                  An essential must visit and one of the most authentic places I
                  visited in Tokyo. With loads of little shops full of
                  knick-knacks and souvenirs, food/snacks stalls along the strip
                  towards Sensoji Castle, girls dressed in traditional garments,
                  it's truly a sight to see and I highly recommend. Had the BEST
                  matcha ice cream there as well!

                <h4>Golden Gai</h4>
                <p>
                  Shinjuku Golden Gai is a small area, which is located in
                  Kabukicho, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan. It is composed of a network
                  of six narrow alleys, connected by even narrower passageways
                  which are about wide enough for a single person to pass
                  through.

                <h5>What I like About It</h5>
                <p>
                  It's a compilation of tiny (and I mean TINY) bars, fitting
                  probably no more than 6 people at a time. Great way to meet
                  locals and have conversations with the owners! My favourite
                  Izakaya (Â±ÖÈÖíÂ±ã) was called Deathmatch in Hell! With no table
                  charge and all drinks costing only ¬•666, making it cheaper
                  that almost all the surrounds=ing bars. Make sure to show up
                  early because it gets PACKED quickly.
